# SFITS — Startup Funding & Investor Tracking System

# A full-stack web application for managing startups, funding rounds, investor ownership, and equity dilution over time — built as a DBMS mini project.

# When a startup raises funds from multiple investors across multiple funding rounds, tracking ownership percentages becomes increasingly complex. Each new investment leads to changes in existing ownership due to equity dilution, making it difficult to maintain accurate records over time. Without a structured system, ownership data may be overwritten or lost, preventing reliable historical analysis. The Startup Funding and Investment Tracking System (SFITS) addresses this problem by organizing data related to startups, investors, funding rounds, and investments using a structured relational database. It also maintains a complete history of ownership changes after each funding round, enabling stakeholders to accurately track and query ownership distribution at any stage, such as “Who owned how much at a specific funding round?
